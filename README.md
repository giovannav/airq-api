#### AIRQ Api
This project was undertaken as the final assignment for an integration discipline in the ninth semester of my Computer Engineering major.

It constitutes half of a two-part initiative aimed at creating an air quality station for evaluating air quality in enclosed environments.

This repository encompasses the API segment and the code for two microcontrollers integrated into the system.

The API was developed using Python and the FastAPI library. Deployment of the API took place through AWS Lambda, with DynamoDB serving as the chosen database.

These deployment resources were selected for their extensive documentation, cost-effectiveness, and low latency attributes for the database.

For a visual demonstration of the project in operation, a video is available on YouTube at the following link: https://youtu.be/q_yTyegimSQ
