#### AIRQ Api
This project was done as the final project of an integration discipline in ninith semester of mi CE major.
It's half of a two part project to create an air quality station to evaluate air quality in closed environments.
This repository has the API part and the code for two microcontrollers integrated in the system.
The API was developed in Python, using the FastAPI library. The API was deployed using AWS Lambda and using DynamoDB as a database.
These deployment resources were chosen due to its large documenation, low cost and low latency for the database.
